## What is INSERT INTO?
The main goal of database systems is to store data in the tables. The data is usually supplied by application programs that run on top of the database. Towards that end, SQL has the INSERT command that is used to store data into a table.
The INSERT command creates a new row in the table to store data.

### Synatx
```
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```
